# Project 7 - Artificial Neural Networks: Bank Churn Prediction
15-year U.S. Air Force vet—4 years SIGINT, 11 years aerospace data—predicts bank churn with ANNs. From my UT-Austin AI/ML cert (2021, refreshed Feb 2025), this Python/TensorFlow project nails ~10k-row bank data—~86% accuracy via a tuned neural net. Like my $13B IT forecasts (GSA) and F-16 sim fixes, it’s data precision under fire—adaptable to space crew retention.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Predict churn—ANN (~86% accuracy, F1 ~0.60).
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Dataset**: Bank Churn (~10k rows, 14 features—CreditScore, Age, Exited, etc.).
- **Results**: ~86% accuracy—tuned layers, balanced churn detection.

## Setup
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/josh-koonce/notebooks.git`
- Navigate: `cd notebooks/Project%207%20-%20Artificial%20Neural%20Networks`
- Run: `jupyter notebook Project%207%20-%20Artificial%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Joshua%20Koonce.ipynb`

## Notes
- Built 2021, polished Feb 2025—see my 7M/$3B Tinker workloads for scale.
