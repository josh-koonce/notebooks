# Project 5 - Feature Selection & Model Tuning: Bank Churn Prediction
15-year U.S. Air Force vet—4 years SIGINT, 11 years aerospace data—tackles bank churn with feature selection grit. From my UT-Austin AI/ML cert (2021, refreshed Feb 2025), this Python/Scikit-learn project predicts customer churn on a ~10k-row banking dataset—~90% accuracy with Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Like my $13B IT forecasts (GSA) and F-16 sim fixes, it’s data precision under fire—adaptable to space ops analytics.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Predict bank churn—Random Forest (~90%), Logistic Regression (~87%).
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (SelectKBest, GridSearchCV), Matplotlib.
- **Dataset**: Bank Churn (~10k rows, 21 features—Customer_Age, Credit_Limit, etc.).
- **Results**: ~90% accuracy—tuned baseline, feature-optimized.

## Setup
