# Josh Koonce - AI/ML Portfolio
Analyst with 15 years of U.S. Air Force service—4 years in SIGINT, 11 years optimizing aerospace data systems. Pursuing a Master’s in Data Science (4.0 GPA, in progress). This repo showcases my AI/ML projects from UT-Austin (2021, refreshed Feb 2025), blending Python, TensorFlow, and real-world problem-solving—adaptable to aerospace and space innovation.

## Projects
- **[CNN Image Classification](https://github.com/josh-koonce/notebooks/tree/main/Project%208%20-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Network)**: Classified CIFAR-10 subset (~5k images) with TensorFlow/Keras—~87% final accuracy, baseline tunable for flight sims.
- **[Elite Dangerous Stellar Data](https://github.com/josh-koonce/notebooks/tree/main/Personal%20Project%20-%20Elite%20Dangerous%20Stellar%20Data)**: Clustered 65M+ star systems with decision trees and a simple neural net for exploration, ~95% classification accuracy.

## Skills
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), SQL, Power BI, SAS JMP—forged in aerospace ops ($1B+ budgets, F-16 sims), ready for aerospace challenges.
