# Project 4 - Ensemble Techniques: Travel Package Prediction
15-year U.S. Air Force vet—4 years SIGINT, 11 years aerospace data—predicts travel package uptake with ensemble flair. From my UT-Austin AI/ML cert (2021, refreshed Feb 2025), this Python/Scikit-learn project hits a ~5k-row tourism dataset with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Like my $13B IT forecasts (GSA) and F-16 sim fixes, it’s data grit under pressure—adaptable to space ops analytics.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Predict travel package purchases—Random Forest (~90%), Gradient Boosting (~94%). Used F1 as target metric ultimately.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Dataset**: Travel (~5k rows, 20 features—Age, CityTier, ProdTaken, etc.).
- **Results**: ~82% accuracy—baseline, tunable with ensembles/boosting to 90s.

## Setup
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/josh-koonce/notebooks.git`
- Navigate: `cd notebooks/Project%204%20-%20Ensemble%20Techniques`
- Run: `jupyter notebook Project%204%20-%20Ensemble%20Techniques%20-%20Joshua%20Koonce.ipynb`

## Notes
- Built 2021, polished Feb 2025—see my 7M/$3B Tinker workloads for scale.
